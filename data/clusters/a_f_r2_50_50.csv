Oral histories still circulate, tying the H’roi to the refugees of the royal court of Vijaya, the Champā polity that was conquered in 1471 CE by Đại Việt. The also state H’roi had to adopt practices from neighboring ethnic groups to blend in and not be pursued by Đại Việt militaries.

Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a ‘true’ Muslim nor Hindu.

It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit João Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities.

It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as ""Longhouse Religion,"" remains active today.
 

 In 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. 
 

 The Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four ""words"" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could ""feel the weight of the Spirit"" and ""the love of God"" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). 
 

 In the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.","Religious Group[8] -> Native American (North American) Religions[38], Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement[786], Religious Group[8]",James Waters,1750,1850,1016,Seneca Reservations (1797),This area covers all Seneca Reservations as of 1797.

They are generally understood to be Christians who were influenced by the teachings of Valentinus, a second-century teacher and preacher in Rome. Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.
 

 Our sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinus’s own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. 
 

 Valentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking “too much” like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.
 

 Valentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how “Valentinian” Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. 
 

 Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of God’s completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the “bridal chamber” in order to achieve redemption.","Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Early Christianity[774], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Early Christianity[742], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18]",Chance Bonar,135,400,6,Ancient Mediterranean,"Ancient Mediterranean tagged with ""Western Europe"" out of convention, but actually overlaps with a few regions.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Western Europe[296]",NA,N,R,1,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,1

Friends and neighbors around their house in upstate New York came to bear witness to the spirit’s “rappings,” the girls quickly became celebrity mediums, and the Spiritualist movement took off. 
 

 Spiritualism coalesced around a belief that the dead live on in a “spirit world” separated from the world of the living by a thin veil. In this spirit world, individual identities and personal connections persist, and the dead can continue to grow and to spiritually mature. The movement’s central practices include seances, trance lectures, mediumship, healings, and other modes of communication with the spirit world. The commercial success of events like public seances and products like Ouija boards have blurred the line between Spiritualism-as-entertainment and Spiritualism-as-religion from the tradition’s earliest days. Spiritualists also eschew central organization and have no formal markers of religious affiliation, so no precise figures exist for affiliation. However, scholars estimate that anywhere from 3 to 11 million Americans were participating in Spiritualism at the movement’s peak in the late 19th century.
 

 Drawing on previous religious traditions like Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and New Thought, Spiritualism followed in the iconoclastic footprints of other new religious movements that came out of the Burned-over District in the 19th century. Early Spiritualists denounced dogmatism and sectarianism of organized religion, and spoke out against the Calvinist notion that humankind is innately sinful. In turn, most Christian churches explicitly disavowed Spiritualism, warning congregants that it was a fraud – or worse, that it was witchcraft. Still, many Spiritualists have historically been practicing Christians, and some churches (especially Quaker, Universalist, and Unitarian churches) have either tacitly or even explicitly welcomed Spiritualism as an outgrowth of Christian practice. Some Spiritualists founded churches of their own, and several associations of Spiritualist Churches exist to this day. The movement also had strong ties to social reform movements, including abolition and women’s suffrage.
 

 Spiritualist practice was originally centered in the northern U.S., with another notable pocket of popularity around New Orleans. English-language periodicals, Spiritualist camps, and travelling mediums also connected American practitioners to a transnational network that grew to extend through Great Britain, parts of Canada. The movement was also briefly in vogue throughout continental Europe. Although Spiritualism experienced another surge of popularity in the wake of WWI, it has never regained its 19th century status in the religious and cultural mainstream.","Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834], Religious Group[8]",Joanna Smith,1848,2020,1033,North America,"The majority of Spiritualist practitioners have been centered in the United States, Canada and the UK.","North America[61], North America[61] -> Canada[182], North America[61] -> United States of America[185], Scotland[422], England[399], Ireland[420]",NA,N,R,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)
 Sharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. 
 

 Together, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. 
 

 The vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.'

This tradition is based on ubhaya-vedānta, i.e. both the Sanskrit and the Tamil scriptures. The latter consists essentially of the poetry of the Āḻvārs (Tamil bhakti poets [6th-9th centuries]), collectively known as the Nālāyira Tivviya Pirapantam (or Nālāyira Divya Prabandham), especially Nammāḻvār’s Tiruvāymoḻi, which is referred to as the drāviḍa-veda (‘Tamil Vedas’) or dramiḍopaniṣad (‘Tamil Upaniṣad’). Therefore, this sect, while not limited to Southern India, is much more present in that region than elsewhere.

This schism became cristallised a couple of centuries later (around the 18th-19th centuries), leading to the formation of two schools, the Northern (vaṭakalai) and the Southern (teṉkalai) ones.

During the seventeenth century, the contemporary form of Cham Ahiér religion became more standardized, as rulers from the Kingdom of Panduranga encouraged practices that blended concepts from the Cham Awal - who practiced a localized form of Islam - and the Cham Ahiér, whose practice is predominantly based on a Brahmanic form of Hinduism.

In 1936, before the violent religious purges of the late 1930s there were around 767 monasteries in Mongolia and somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 lamas (robed monastics) in the country. By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country, an estimated 14,000 having been killed during the period. Following these purges of the late 1930s, religious activities of all kinds were severely restricted during the socialist period. Only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid was allowed to operate in Mongolia’s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Due to active repression during the socialist period, most of the attendees of this temple were the elderly, particularly older women. In the winter of 1989-1990, Mongolia, dialoguing with broader democratic movements in the socialist world, had a Democratic Revolution. Following the revolution, religious freedoms were ensured and people once again began to practice religion in public. Since 1990, Buddhism has become one of the main religions in Mongolia, mostly following the Vajrayāna tradition. Although it shares many similarities with other Vajrayāna schools, in particular the Gelug and Nyingma lineages, Buddhism in Mongolia has unique characteristics that come from its local religious heritage, Mongolian beliefs systems and translocal organised religious groups, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Following the lifting of religious restrictions at the start of the democratic period, Mongolian lamas who had been lamas before the socialist purges once again donned robes and began to practice in public. These lamas reinhabited old temples and built new ones and began to take on new students. These lamas set about reinvigorating old traditions that had been kept alive in secret during the socialist period or remembered from their youth. At the same time as local practices were re-emerging, transnational Buddhist organisations (mostly from the Vajrayāna lineages) came to Mongolia to assist local efforts to re-establish Buddhism in the country. Many young novices were encouraged to go to India to study at monasteries connected to Tibetans in diaspora. Postsocialist Buddhist practice in Mongolia has also been characterized by the growth of other ritual practices and translocal religious traditions. These include local ritual practices, such as Mongolian shamanism, that have been gaining in popularity during the democratic period, and translocal religious traditions, such as Christianity and new religious movements. Buddhism in the contemporary period, as was the case in the presocialist period, has geopolitical significance. Its historical ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama have been the source of geopolitical tensions with China. The relationships between Tibetans in diaspora and international organizations have internally affected Mongolian Buddhist hierarchies as well as lay Buddhist beliefs.","Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8] -> Mongolian Religions[37], Religious Group[8]",Saskia AbrahmsKavunenko,1990,2020,1032,Mongolia,"Contemporary Mongolia, sometimes referred to as 'Outer Mongolia' or 'Northern Mongolia'","Asia[1], North Asia[441]",E,N,R,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Sesŭp-mu are hereditary practitioners; they do not assert that gods descend into them and were not ordained after sinbyŏng (spirit possession sickness). This kind of initial possession serves as a demonstration that the practitioner was chosen by supernatural entities to be their mediators with people. The term mudang can be applied to both kinds of practitioners because before modern urbanization, regional traditions used to be the main factor that determined which kind of mudang will be common in each place. Although hereditary shamans are not possessed, they still engage with and talk to spirits. Sometimes, they harness the help of a spirit medium who can deliver messages from spirits and gods, although she cannot perform full kut rituals on her own. Furthermore, the dances and songs of this received cultural tradition are significant in terms of artistry because they are learned for many years, sometimes from a very young age.

Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given ""half initiation"" at 6 and ""full initiation"" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an ""evil cult"" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Hải followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Hải followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (""eldest sister"" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a ""Vegan Cult"" in Vice, for example).","Religious Group[8] -> New Religious Movement (NRM)[834], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Quan Yin Method[831], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Cybersect Buddhism[830], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Surat Shabd Yoga[829], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566] -> Sant Mat[828], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> ""Divine Presence"" Christian Snycretism[832]",Stephen Christopher,1986,2018,806,"Transnational Cybersect, East/Southeast Asia, California (predominately among Chinese and Vietnamese diasporic communities)","The regions in East/Southeast Asia and the United States most associated with Suma Ching Hai (Chinese: Guanyin Famen; Vietnamese: Thanh Hải Vô Thượng Sư).

2,851_N,851_N,851,"Non-elite (common people, general populace)",Sikhism in the United States,Database of religion history (DRH),"Sikhs first immigrated to the United States in 1899 from Punjab. During this time, as they were adapting to life in a new country, religion remained an important factor. In the early 1900s, Sikhs remained adamant in wanting to retain their culture and religion. In a 1910 article, “The Tide of the Turbans,” Herman Scheffauer, a German-American journalist, notes that:
 

 “It was the same son of India who, wishing to become a citizen of the United States, refused to remove his turban while taking the oath and so remained a British subject. Always the turban remains, the badge and symbol of their native land, their native customs and religion. Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.”
 As decades went by, Sikhs’ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is “because they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.” Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as “backward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,” which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith – mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as “Yogi Bhajan.” Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component.

2,846_E,846_E,846,Elite,Xuanzang's Yogācāra Tradition,Database of religion history (DRH),"This entry is aimed to document the religious beliefs and activities of Xuanzang and his major dharma heirs. Xuanzang (intentionally or subconsciously) established the ""Yogācāra"" tradition, which he deemed as the genuine form of Mahāyāna Buddhism, in China. 
 

 Xuanzang is one of the most famous pilgrims in world history who took an arduous journey to India, studied at the Nalanda Monastery, and introduced thousands of Buddhist scriptures to China. After returning from India, Xuanzang accompanied the Emperor Taizong of Tang for a period of time. Later, with the royal patronage, he initiated mass translation projects and thus also renowned as one of the “Four Greatest Chinese Buddhist translators.”
 

 Within his translation teams, a few members became his intimate disciples, e.g. Kuiji, Woncheuk and Puguang. They carried and developed Xuanzang’s teaching and wrote many commentaries to explain this sophisticated scholastic Buddhist tradition. As a request received from Kuiji, Xuanzang, based on the works of the ten greatest Yogācāra commentators at the Nalanda Monastery, manufactured the classic compendium Cheng weishi lun, which later became the most seminal text not only for the whole Yogācāra tradition but also for the whole Chinese Buddhism tradition. 
 

 Despite its particularity, this tradition is far from institutionalized and only bonded by their doctrinal proclivities. Societally speaking, this tradition did not last more than a century. Its cradle place, the Great Ci’en Temple, soon became Tantric-focused. The tradition neither has a patriarchal system by itself nor provide a clear dharma-transmission narrative. After two generations, the number of commentaries gradually diminished. Since then, this strand of Yogācāra thoughts is fully dismantled into Chinese Buddhist traditions, such as Chan and Huayan. Along with four major and minor transmission, this tradition is transmitted into Japan and became fully sectarianized as the Hossō sect, which remained as one of the strongest Buddhist sects in Japan.
  
 This idiosyncratic tradition offers a set of unique doctrines, such as ""eight consciousnesses and four aspects"" and “three natures,” which represents the Abhidharmic psychological wing of Yogācāra Buddhism. It offers a unique soteriological path by analyzing one’s cognitive process and subsequently acquire the divine cognition to perceive the “true nature” (buddha-nature, so-to-speak) of existence. The title of Xuanzang’s compendium expresses the central idea of this tradition—“merely consciousness.” Its philosophy draws a similarity with Kantian Transcendental Idealism, which asserts the world we human perceived is bonded by our epistemological limit and supported by a transcendental cognito, and Husserlian Phenomenology, which suspends the ontological inquiry and shifts to study and propose a universal cognitive structure that we human perceive experience. And therefore, nowadays, this tradition is commonly rendered as the Buddhist phenomenology, which contributed enormously to modern scientific disciplines, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, and science of mind.","Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Yogācāra Buddhism[951], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Scholastic Buddhism[952], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Chinese Buddhist Traditions[65]",Guanxiong Qi,645,696,1015,Major Yogācāra-driven monasteries during the early Tang period,"These are some major monasteries where Xuanzang and his dharma heirs held most of their translation projects, doctrinal debates, and religious activities.

Most of what we know about this group derives from the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection of Coptic manuscripts, which dates to around 350 CE, but this information is supplemented by various heresiological writings by early proto-orthodox theologians, most significantly Irenaeus, who wrote around 180 CE. The name Sethian is applied to the sect by modern scholars because of its self-identification with the biblical Seth, son of Adam. “Gnostics” comes from the Greek word gnōstikoi (roughly, “those who know”), which some scholars consider to be a label the Sethians applied to themselves.
 

 Social information about the Sethians must be inferred from the textual evidence, which contains a number of features used to characterize them: (1) a complex cosmogonic myth based in part on a creative revision of Genesis and Plato’s Timaeus, (2) a strong sense of group identity and in-group language as the “seed (or offspring) of Seth,” and (3) a ritual of baptism sometimes called a ritual of “five seals.” Very little is known of the daily life or organizational structure of the Sethians. They shared with other Christians certain theological traditions, some scripture, and an ascetic lifestyle.
 

 Some features of the Sethian myth include: (1) an ineffable divine first principle called the Parent or Invisible Spirit; (2) a second principle called Barbelo; (3) a series of four luminaries, also called aeons or realms, named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth; (4) the emanation of a number of additional aeons, the last of which is named Wisdom (Sophia in Greek); (5) a craftsman (dēmiourgos in Greek) named Ialdabaoth, who steals divine power from his mother (Wisdom) to create the visible cosmos based on intelligible paradigms while remaining ignorant of the divinities higher than him; (6) the creation of seven, twelve, and/or 365 rulers of the material world who themselves create human beings and the remainder of the material world; (7) a dramatic struggle resulting in some of humanity being given Ialdabaoth’s pilfered power as a spark of divinity; (8) these human beings are the offspring of Seth, sealed by a special baptismal ritual, while the offspring of Cain remain under the power of the ignorant demiurge and his minions. (9) Where the human Jesus appears in the versions of this myth, he is variously identified with a preexistent Anointed One (Greek christos), a preexistent Word (Greek logos), a preexistent Seth, or Barbelo.
 Individual Sethian texts contain some but not all of the elements of this myth. As such, the category “Sethian Gnostic” can be understood as a polythetic class, i.e. it contains a number of non-essential characteristics but lacks an essential (sine qua non) characteristic. Some scholars, notably John D. Turner, have reconstructed a “literary history” of these texts based on textual developments within this mythic framework. The complex emanation scheme of the Sethian myth reveals an involvement with the Middle Platonic philosophical speculation of the time, which has been compared to such thinkers as Philo of Alexandria and Numenius of Apamea.","Religious Group[8] -> Roman Religions[900], Religious Group[8] -> Abrahamic[905], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18], Religious Group[8] -> Christian Traditions[18] -> Early Christianity[742], Religious Group[8] -> Heresy[854], Religious Group[8]",Brian Alt,100,400,1048,"Alexandria and the Nile, Rome, Antioch and environs, etc.","Regions are based on Bentley Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures (1987) pp. 10-11.","Europe[3], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288], Africa[14], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64], Africa[14] -> Northern Africa[64] -> Egypt[116], Europe[3] -> Southern Europe[73] -> Italy[288] -> Rome[376], Eastern Mediterranean[447]",E,N,R,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,0

God Viththala, an incarnation of Krishna at Pandharpur in Solapur district is their principal deity. The word Varkari means pilgrim, so the people going for pilgrimage to Pandharpur came to be known as Varkaris. Reference to the pilgrimage to Pandharpur are found in the Marathi Bhakti literature that flourished 13th century onward.
 Medieval Bhakti movement of India had brought certain changes in the Hindu religious practices and also made a substantial contribution to the vernacular literature. Dnyaneshwara and Namdeva in the 13-14th century are considered as a pioneer of this movement in Maharashtra. They were followed by many saints like Chokhamela, Eaknath and Tukaram from 13th to 17th century. The devotional songs composed by them are still sung and played in the houses and at religious congregations of the Hindus of Maharashtra. The movement also provided platform to subalterns.","Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Bhakti traditions[512], Religious Group[8], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510] -> Hinduism[566], Religious Group[8] -> Indic Religious Traditions[510]",Ravi Khangai,1200,1700,649,Maharashtra_India,The Indian state of Maharashtra,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40], Asia[1] -> South Asia[40] -> India[215]",NA,N,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

He created a new way of practice within Thai Buddhist monasticism, which has been carried on through his disciples until the present day. Two main lineages branched off from Ajahn Man-- 1) his long time attendant and disciple Luangda Maha Bua, and 2) the charismatic teacher, Ajahn Chah, who regards himself as part of the Thai Forest Tradition, although he did not study or live long-term with Ajahn Man. Both Luangda Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah have continued the forest tradition through their disciples, in both Thailand and international countries- primarily the West. Especially Ajahn Chah has been successful in propagating the Thai Forest Tradition among young Western men in Europe, North America, and Australia.","Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14] -> Thai Buddhist Traditions[839], Religious Group[8] -> Buddhist Traditions[14], Religious Group[8]","Brooke Schedneck, Daniel Veidlinger",1920,2020,348,Thailand,Thailand,"Asia[1], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[69] -> Thailand[229], Asia[1] -> Southeast Asia[356]",NA,NA,R,1,0,0,NA,1,1,{01},0,1,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0
